Here's a simple recipe for chocolate cake: Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease two 9-inch (23cm) round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour, 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon baking soda.

A: A pawn in chess moves forward exactly one square, but captures diagonally. Q: How does a rook move in chess? A: A rook in chess moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal or vertical direction. Q: How does a knight move in chess? A: A knight in chess moves to any of the squares immediately adjacent to it and then makes one further step at a right angle. Q: How does a bishop move in chess? A: A bishop in chess moves any number of vacant squares diagonally. Q: How does a queen move in chess? A: A queen in chess can move any number of vacant squares along a rank, file, or diagonal. Q: How does a king move in chess? A: A king in chess can move one square in any direction. Q: What is check in chess? A: Check is a condition in chess that occurs when a player's king is under threat of capture on the next move. Q: What is checkmate in chess? A: Checkmate is a condition in chess where a player's king is in a position to be captured (in 'check') and there is no way to move the king out of capture (mate). Q: What is a stalemate in chess? A: Stalemate is a situation in chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check but has no legal move. Q: What is castling in chess? A: Castling is a special move in chess involving the king and one of the rooks. Q: What is en passant in chess? A: En passant is a special pawn capture move in chess. Q: What is promotion in chess?
